## üöÄ Projects

### **OrbitBank**
*Completed: April 2025* | [üöÄ Live Demo](http://54.172.130.207:8000/docs) | [üêô GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Aditya-kr-jha/OrbitBank_v2)

- Architected and developed a secure Banking API in Python & FastAPI featuring 60+ endpoints for core banking operations, including user registration (with email verification), account management, fund transfers, and transaction logging, achieving average response times under 200 ms.
- Secured all routes with JWT authentication, utilized PostgreSQL on AWS RDS for data persistence, and managed schema migrations via Alembic, ensuring full ACID compliance with atomic transactions and automatic rollback on failure.
- Integrated asynchronous background tasks for email/SMS notifications using AWS SES/SNS, designed to support over 14,000 messages/sec, reducing API latency by approximately 65% and delivering real-time alerts.
- Implemented a comprehensive end-to-end CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, Docker, and AWS (ECR & EC2), slashing deployment times from 15 minutes to 2 minutes and enabling zero-downtime releases at three times the previous cadence.

**Technologies:** Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, AWS (RDS, SES, SNS, ECR, EC2), Alembic, JWT, Docker, GitHub Actions, CI/CD.

### **Zync Chat**
*Completed: January 2025* | [üöÄ Live Demo](https://dg9qzy1dkyjl5.cloudfront.net) | [üêô GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Aditya-kr-jha/ChatApp_v2)

- Engineered a full-stack, real-time chat application ("Zync") by architecting a high-performance Python (FastAPI) backend (RESTful APIs & WebSockets) and developing a responsive React frontend.
- Implemented secure end-to-end user authentication and session management using JWTs & OAuth2 on the backend and React Context API on the frontend, safeguarding 30+ API endpoints and WebSocket channels.
- Integrated AWS S3 for scalable cloud storage of user-uploaded files, including backend logic for secure uploads and pre-signed URL generation.
- Deployed the application for global accessibility using AWS CloudFront for frontend delivery and Render for scalable backend API hosting.

**Technologies:** Python, FastAPI, React, WebSockets, JWT, OAuth2, AWS (S3, CloudFront), Render, RESTful APIs.
